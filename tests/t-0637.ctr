# Setting alarm

# terminates the program after 1 sec.
Program alarm: 1.

Out write: ['max 1 sec.'], stop.
Moment wait: 2.
Out write: ['takes too long.'], stop.

# note:
# Setting an alarm is irreversible,
# an attacker cannot disable it.
# After the first call, the alarm is locked.
# Also the alarm is really harsh,
# the program *WILL* be stopped after the
# specified time interval, even if it is
# in a blocking read or something.

# note:
# Alarm is heavy, consider setting basic
# timeouts in the webserver instead.
