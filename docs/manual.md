After it has been transferred to your computer, you can extract the file
and start xo by using the following command:

```
xo
```

To run a Xoscript, store the program as a file by adding -xo
suffix (optional). In addition, insert the file name of your program
after the Xoscript command:

```
xo myprogram.xo
```

When you run a Xoscript command while using your program file as a
parameter, xo will read and execute your program file.

{{note}}
You can also start your program by dragging it to the xo pictogram.
{{/note}}

{{warning}}
On some systems you need to allow xo permissions to load dynamic
libraries beforehand.

Tradition dictates that the first program in any new programming
language should be a kind of salute to the world. In Xoscript, such a
**Hello world** program looks like this:

@test598

When this text is saved to a file, e.g. hello.xo, it can be executed as
follows: .

xo hello.xo

Hello world

## Syntax 

Xoscript is a *pure* *object-oriented* programming language. This means
that xoscript perceives everything to be an object, therefore there are
no other *data types*. There are essentially three basic routine actions
in a program that is written in Xoscript: *assigning*, *sending messages*
and *responding*. Exchanging messages between objects is the key part of
a Xoscript program. The three individual routine actions are illustrated
below:


Action          | Example
--------------- | --------
assign          |  \>\> x := 1. 
unary Messages  | x even?.
binary message  | 1 + 2.
keyword message | x from: 0 length: 10.
answer          | <- answer.  


This chapter will give you a general impression of the language Xoscript
and describes its basic principles. Xoscript is a small language and
founded on three actions (see illustration) which translate into
approximately six grammar rules. That is all it takes to master the
language.

No worries if things are not instantly obvious to you: all building
stones will be explored in the next chapter (3) and the basic rules will
be repeated. Current chapter, however, serves mainly as a general
introduction to the language. The basic principles will be briefly
explained and illustrated by several relevant examples. Any missing
details will be outlined at a later moment.

Comments in Xoscript are prefixed with a \# symbol. So the following line
will be ignored:

```
# this is just a comment
```

## Variables

To assign
a variable you use the variable declaration symbol: >>. The name of a
variable may contain all signs except for: <-, :=, whitespaces,
periods, commas, colons, quotation marks [' '], and parentheses ().
Furthermore, a variable cannot consist of multiple lines. Please note
that a variable cannot begin with a number or a minus sign.

These are examples of valid variables:

```
>> password := ['Secret'].
>> ♡♡♡ := 3.
>> $ := ['dollar'].
>> +plus := True.
>> user-password := ['Pssst!'].
```

Invalid variables are for example:


```
>> -123 := ['negative number'].
>> password of user := ['Classified'].
>> password.of:user := ['Classified'].
>> ,x := 10.
```

After a variable has been declared, it can be used freely. This means
that it is only necessary to use the declaration symbol the first time
you use the variable (the declaration).

To be more specific, you cannot randomly start to declare a value to
your variable *(x := 2)*, as you must first declare the variable *(\>\>
x := 2)*. However, once declared you are allowed to change its value
without using the declaration symbol*(\>\> x := 2. x := 3.)*.

Note that it is mandatory to assign a value to a variable at the time of
declaring. Contrary to other programming languages, you are not allowed
to declare a variable without value. It is essential to explicitly tie
each variable to an initial value. Nonetheless, feel free to initialise
the variable with the **None** object. In this case, the variable can be
regarded as being empty *(\>\> x := None.)*. In short, to declare a
variable without an initial value is not allowed. So,

```
>> x.
```

is invalid and will give an error message.

## Literals

Xoscript perceives everything to be an object; i.e., all numbers, texts
and code fragments. Numbers, such as 1, 2, 100, -999 and 1,234 are
Number objects. All texts between single quotation marks are String
objects. All code fragments grouped between curly brackets {...} are
Function objects.

Literal         | Root object  | Example
--------------- | ------------ | ----------
numbers         | Number       | 1,2,3... 
strings         | String       | \['hello'\]
function        | Function     | { 1 + 2. }.
                
     
Objects such as numbers and strings, always find their origin in a root
object. For example, all numbers derive from the object **Number**. All
strings derive from **String** and all code fragments from **Function**. In
turn, all these objects stem from **Object**, which is, in fact, the
root object of all objects.


## Messages

Programming in Xoscript basically means
sending messages to objects. The general notation to send a message to
an object is as follows:

```
&lt;object&gt; &lt;message&gt;
```

To find out if the number **2**, for example, is an even number, the
message **even?** is sent to object **2**:

```
2 even?
```

The answer will be **True** (again, an object). Unknown messages are
usually ignored by objects; so no error will occur. Some objects (e.g.,
numbers or strings) respond to an unknown message in a predefined way
(more on this subject later).

An object can receive three kinds of messages. 

Type            | Number of arguments
--------------- | -------------------
Unary           | 0      
Binary          | 1     
Keyword         | 1+    


First, there are **unary
messages**, see example above, which are without arguments. Second,
there are **keyword messages**, which have one or multiple arguments,
for example:

```
>> x := Number between: 1 and: 10.
```

In this case the message **between:and: ** is sent to **Number**, which
is the root object of all numbers. The result will be a random number
between 1 and 10. Finally, there are **binary messages**, which have
only one character and one argument:

```
2 + 3
```

This looks like a math sum, but it actually just another message. The
message **+** is sent to **2**, with argument **3** which will return
answer **5**. Binary messages are allowed to be written without a colon.

Binary messages can be chained:

```
>> x := 3 + 2 - 1.
```

In this fragment **+ 2** is first sent to **Number** object **3**, which
results in Number object **5**, after which **-1** is sent to this
number. Observant readers are correct to notice the discrepancy which
this protocol shows regarding the conventional mathematical sequences of
operators. Xoscript ignores the mathematical sequence in favour of
consistency in its message system. As a result, the sum:

```
2 + 3 * 5 = 25
```

not 17.

This is by design. Parentheses can be used to modify the sequence order:

```
2 + (3 * 5) = 17
```

Most objects return themselves as a result in response to a certain
message. This is helpful as it encourages further dialogue with this
object by sending it a follow-up message:

```
Out write:
[' hello '] trim upper.
```

```
HELLO
```

Here, two messages are sent to the **Text** object: **trim**, followed
by **upper**.

In the following fragment, the use of a comma is necessary to indicate
that a new message is incoming. If not, Xoscript will get confused.

```
Out write: ['Hello!'], stop.
```

First, the message **write:** is sent to the pencil symbol followed by
**stop**. Without the comma, Xoscript would think that you wish to send
**stop** to **string** **Hello!**, a futile exercise.

The process sequence of messages is as follows: from left to right;
start with messages in parentheses followed by unary messages. Next,
binary messages and then end with keyword messages. See the example
below:

```
Out write: 0.5 round + (2 - 1), stop.
```

Xoscript always reads from left to right: first, the message **write:**
is sent to Out and is followed by the **stop** message. Within the
argument itself, Xoscript reads from left to right, so **0.5 round**
then **+**.

Moreover, **round** takes precedence over **+**, because it is a
**unary message**. Given the parentheses, **2 - 1** is calculated
first, after which **1** is added to the result of **0.5 round** (1).

The whole process will give the result **2**, which is also the written
answer. After the comma follows the stop message, which moves the cursor
to a new line. Of course, the best way to fully comprehend the sequence
order of Xoscript programs is with practise.

It is worthy to note that in Xoscript, contrary to many other programming
languages, whitespaces are a fundamental part of its syntax. In
particular when it comes to binary messages, whitespaces may cause some
confusion. Always use a whitespace after a binary message. You cannot
directly attach a number to the message, for example: 

```
3 + 2
```

different from 

```
3 +2
```

The first example (**3 + 2**), sends the
message **+** to the number **3**, with argument the number **2**. The
result, in this case, will be **5**. In the second example (**3 +2**) ,
the unary message **+2** is sent to number **3**. Depending on the
context that might yield a very different result.

## Control Flow

In Xoscript there is no need for separate grammar rules for *loops* and
*ifs*. An if-statement is just a simple **true:** or **false:** message
to either a **True** object or a **False** object:

```
2 even? true: {
	Out write: ['Two is an even number'], stop.
}.
```
In the previous example, the message **true:** is sent to **True**, (the
answer to the question: is 2 an even number?) As argument an additional
fragment of code is sent along: a **Function** object. This function writes on
the screen that 2 is, in fact, an even number.

There is no need either for separate writing rules for a *loop*. To
execute a fragment of code three times, simply send **\*** with argument
**3** to that **Function**:

@test5

Let's consider another example. When a conversion table needs to be
printed from *kJ* (kilojoule) into *kcal* (kilocalorie) by steps of 100,
see below for the correct notation:

@test599

Here, the number of the current line is transmitted to the parameter
**:line**. At the beginning of a function, the function parameters are being
defined. Unused parameters remain empty (**None**). Parameters are
always placed at the start of the function, directly after the initial
curly bracket and are preceded by a colon.

The message **while:**, is a combination of a *loop* and a *condition*.
Two functions can be linked using the **while:** message. The receiving function
will continue to run until the function after the colon will give a negative
result. Example:

@test600

In the above-illustrated code fragment **1** is added to **x** as long
as **x** is less than **5**. When this is no longer the case, the second
function will answer with **False**, consequently, the execution of the
first function will end.

## String interpolation

The *kJ/kcal* list could be made more
presentable. Preferably, the list would be as follows:

```
100 kj ➞ 23.88 kcal

200 kj ➞ 47.76 kcal
```

When you convert the preferred output into a template, its notation
could be:

```
number1 kJ ➞ number2 kcal
```

This means that **number1** stands for kJ-value and **number2** for
kcal-value. This is how string interpolation operates in Xoscript. There
are no separate grammar rules needed for this in Xoscript. Simply send
the word that needs to be replaced to the text with the substitute text
as argument:

```
>> text :=

['number1 kJ ➞ number2 kcal']

number1: 100,

number2: 23.9.
```

The result:

```
100 kj ➞ 23.9 kcal
```

This substitution rule works for each undefined message that is received
by a **string** object. Each message that is not recognised by the
**string** object, will be interpreted as follows: *replace the message
text with the text within the message argument.* You can adapt the
program as follows:


@test601


To avoid confusion about which message can or cannot be used as a
substitute, it is best to introduce a template marker like &lt; &gt;
for text segments in the template that
need to be replaced.

## Return values

To answer a message the return arrow
(*<-*) is used. The following example illustrates how to create a task
to compute a percentage:

@test602

After the task has been defined and assigned to variable **percentage**,
the message **apply:and:** is sent with arguments **100** and **7**.

This will execute the task applied to **100** and **7**, i.e., 7% of 100.
Using the return arrow, the answer is returned from the task back
to the main program.

## Extending

Although this code is valid, it has a disadvantage
because the sequence of the arguments has to be remembered. So, why not
write it like this: *7 percent of: 100 *? That would look a lot more
*natural*. To make this possible, we have to adapt the parent object of
**7**, which is the **Number** object, so that it will understand the
message **percent of:**. This can be achieved by sending **on:do:** to
the Number object, like so:

@test603

As the percentage is, in this case, the number itself, we refer to self,
the *self* keyword. In short, the symbol self signifies: *send this
message to myself*. 

# Objects

{{messages}}

Besides adjusting and expanding existing objects, you can also create
new objects yourself simply by sending the message **new**. Suppose you
would like to create an invoice object that enforces a numbering
sequence, in that case, you will first need an invoice object.

Knowing that each object derives from another object, which, in turn,
eventually originates from the root object of all objects called Object,
a choice needs to be made regarding on which of those other objects your
new object will be founded. Your new object inherits all properties of
the object on which it is founded, so, to which the **new** message
initially was sent.

In this example a rather neutral object is preferred, one without too
many inherited properties. This offers an easy choice, because in that
case the new object can be based on the root object itself which is
**Object**. The notation of the intended invoice system will then be as
follows:

@test604

The current invoice number is stored in the object, this is why there is
a **own** keyword placed in front of it. This is called a *property*;
more details will follow.

Some businesses prefer to have the year incorporated into the invoice
numbers. In this case, you can create a new invoice object founded on a
former invoice object, but which offers the possibility to its user to
enter a specified year:

@test605

There is no need to write the implementation for the message **number**
again, as it is inherited from the previously written **invoice
object**; consequently, old code can be reused. Xoscript lacks concepts
such as classes and other related concepts. This means that objects can
solely inherit from other objects, also known as *prototypical
inheritance*.

Now, to get back to properties. Object properties can only be approached
from *within the object hierarchy*, so these properties
cannot be perceived by other objects.

Contrary to other programming languages, all properties of objects are
exclusively visible to the object that has created the property and to
derived objects. 

A commonly used technique is to use an object as a kind of *blueprint*,
which is, for instance, the case with the invoices discussed earlier.
Another good example is the **Point**. Let\'s say that you create a
computer program that makes calculations by using points on a map. You
can develop the object **Point** containing the properties of an
x-coordinate and a y-coordinate, which will be made available to the
external world through messages:

@test606

The **=** message compares the two points using the message **and:**. The
first comparison results in a **True** or a **False**. These are boolean
objects. When you send the message **and:** to a True object, and the
argument object after de colon is equally **True**, then you will
receive as answer again **True**. When either one is **False**, you will
receive the answer **False**. Note that one point cannot read the coordinates of the
other one. It is necessary to send a message to the other point to ask
for this data: **x-coordinate** and **y-coordinate**. After all, as has
been explained already, properties are solely retrievable from within
the object family itself. 

Note that the message **=** is used here to execute the point
comparison. Equally, a different message could have been used, such as:
**is:** or **equal:**, however reusing the **=** character seemed
appropriate in this case.

## Inheritance

You can reuse previously written code to create a hierarchy
of objects. For example:

```
>> Animal := Object new.
>> Dog := Animal new.
>> Poodle := Dog new.
```

**In this case, ****Dog**** inherits all the behaviour of ****Animal****
and, in turn, the object ****Animal**** inherits all behaviour of
****Object****, the root object of all objects.**

## Overriding


**In the following example a new kind of list is created:
****Combination****, in which each element is ensured to be unique. The
functions of the ****Sequence**** are re**used** through inheritance: **

@test607

**Observe how the second ****red**** is excluded from the sequence: **

Occasionally, it may be necessary to override a behaviour of an object.
For instance, when adding numbers and units of measurements have to be
taken into account. In the following example the object **Size** is
created. This object returns a number which, during the addition, takes
into account the unit of the number to be added. The **Number** object
checks whether it is about *inches* or *foot*. The programming code
could resemble the following:

@test608

## Recursion

**In the previous example, the plus **sign** is being overridden. Note
that eventually the final addition still has to be done, which, in fact,
takes place on the following line: **

```
>> answer := self + (number x factor).
```

**Now, **how does Xoscript understand that this plus **sign** refers to
the original logic of addition?** For instance, another interpretation
could be that Xoscript will repeatedly send the same message to the same
object which, in turn, would result into an **endless loop**. Clearly,
this is not the intention. As soon as you send a message to an object,
which would **execute** the **exact** **same code, Xoscript will realise,
in this case, that the underlying, overridden message is meant. So, your
program will automatically be safeguarded against this form of endless
loops. However, when it is indeed your aim to run the same function from the
current function, it will be necessary to first send the message
**recursive**. In this case, the result will be an infinite
loop. **However there are useful applications for recursive tasks, f**or
instance, suppose that you want to calculate the factorial of a given
number. In that case, simply add the message **factorial** to
Number:

@test609

**This calls for recursion. In fact, the task that is connected to the
message ****factorial****, needs to be executed again within that function.
So, it is necessary to invoke the factorial function from within the
factorial function itself. As a rule, Xoscript will prevent this routine,
because of the risk of ending up in an infinite loop. For this reason,
it is vital to precede the message by the word ****recursive****. This
is done in order to make Xoscript aware of the fact that it is your
intention to execute the same task, and that you did not make mistake.

## Class-like Objects

**Creating an object that is set in a given initial state, presents a
frequent issue. Suppose an object ****Rectangle**** has to be created,
in order to calculate perimeter and area. A possible notation would be:
**

```
>> Rectangle := Object new.

Rectangle on: ['area'] do: {
	<- own length * own width.
}.
```

**Obviously, setting a length and width is a precondition. For that
purpose, the messages ****length:**** and ****width:**** can be added:
**

```
Rectangle on: ['length:'] do: { :length
	own length := length.
}.

Rectangle on: ['width:'] do: { :width
	own width := width.
}.

```

This rectangle can then be utilised as follows:


```
>> rectangle := Rectangle new length: 2, width: 3.
Out write: rectangle area.
```

However, if the initial settings of length and width are overlooked,
an error message will occur:

```
>> rectangle := Rectangle new.
Out write: rectangle area.
```

will produce the following error:

```
Key not found: length
```

In order to prevent this, it is preferable that a rectangle should
always have an initial length and width, for example 0. So, in this
case, it is necessary to **override** the message **new**.

@test610

If we override the new-message we are basically mimicking a **class**.

The world of Xoscript is filled with a diversity of objects, which are
available to your program right from the start. In the next chapters,
all of these core objects will be discussed.

# None Object

{{messages}}

The None object
represents emptiness, or better still, the absence of information. On
occasion, you will receive this object as an answer to a message, in
case of the result being ****nothing****. The most essential question
you could ask the ****None**** object is: ****None******?****. The
answer will always read ****True****.**

```
Out write: None None?.
```

result:

```
True
```

**Any object other than ****None**** will reply with ****False****. The
above code fragment may seem a bit philosophical, yet the **None**
object certainly has extremely practical applications. For example, you
**will receive the None object as an answer in case you ask for a
sequence element that does not exist. You could also use the None object
if you like to declare a variable, but do not want to specify a value
yet. Instead, you just **assign** the special value ****None****. In
Xoscript it is not allowed to declare a variable without value, such as:


```
>> value.
```

Instead, you have to write the following:

```
>> value := None.
```

@api_Nil_base



# Booleans

{{messages}}

Contrary to most popular programming languages at the moment of writing,
Xoscript provides for only one single True object and one single False
object. To clarify, each time you write, **True** it does not imply that
a new object has been created. Instead, you always use a reference. This
means that when you write the following:

\>\> x := True.

The **x** refers to the **True** object. Conditional code and loops also
verify this reference. In Xoscript, the meaning of **True** and **False**
is not fixed. In fact, a Xoscript program gets pretty shaken up over a
statement like this:

True := False.

The result of such actions is undefined, however it remains a valid
action and therefore formally allowed. Furthermore, there is a Boolean
object, which is the root object of both **True** and **False**, as both
are derivatives of the root object. The Boolean object itself, however,
does not provide any practical application.

@api_Boolean_base


# Numbers

{{messages}}

Each time you write a number, for example 9, -10, or 3,12, behind the
screen, Xoscript will convert these numbers into a **Number** object. You
can send messages to this Number object, or you could assign the number
to a variable and send messages afterwards:

```
10 even?

>> tenner := 10.
tenner even?

```

Both notations are valid. The Number object responds to the following
messages...

Most of these messages are self-explanatory and allow you to execute
mathematical operations or comparisons.

The difference between binary mathematical messages (+) and
their keyword variations (add:) is that the former will return
a new number, which is the result of the operation, whereas with the
latter the object itself will be modified. This is illustrated in the
following example:

@test597

**In the above example, b = 4 and a = 3. With ****add: 2**** the value
of a is raised by 2, while ****+ 3**** creates a new number that is
equal to a + 3. The same applies to other mathematical processes, e.g.,
multiplications. By using the multiplication symbol, you will receive a
new object as answer. In case you use the message ****multiply by:****,
you will multiply the number itself. **

**With the message ****between:and:****, for example in: ****Number
between: X and: Y****, you will get a number between X and Y. In this
way, any random number can be generated:**

```
>> a := Number between: 1 and: 10.
Out write: a, stop.
```

**Note, that the build-in generator of random numbers in Xoscript is
**not** suitable for** cryptographic applications.**


**You can attach a **qualifier** to a number, for instance, ****6
apples****. Each message that does not **get** recognise**d** **by **a
number will be considered a qualifier. You can retrieve the qualifier of
a number by means of the message ****qualifier****:**

**A qualifier is basically a Text object that is stored with the Number
object. The qualifier is also printed after the number on a
****write:**** assignment. **Q**ualifiers could be used to add amounts
in mixed currencies **for example**. On adding the amounts, you can ask
for the qualifiers. The following program example illustrates this
principle by using a historical currency calculator (as the exchange
rate remains reasonably stable!).**

@test305

@api_Number_base


# Strings

{{messages}}

Each time a text is placed between **quotation marks** ['...'] ,
Xoscript will create a new stringobject for you. However, make
sure to use the correct quotation marks. The quotation mark at the
beginning of the text differs from the one at the end.

## Casting

You can create a copy of each object
with a different type by using the following messages:

Message | Result
------- | ------
number  | Converts an object into a number
text    | Converts an object into text
bool    | Converts an object into a boolean object (True or False)
  
The following rules **apply**:

message  | None      | Bool               | Number                | Text      | Other              
-------- | --------- | --------           | --------              | --------  | --------
bool     | False     | n/a                | 0→False else→True     | True      | Mostly True
number   | 0         | False→0 True→1 | n/a                       | ['n']→n | Mostly 1
string   | ['None']  | ['False']/['True'] | ['n']                 | n/a       | Depends

## Copying

Values in Xoscript are always passed **by reference**. In other languages
it depends on the type of value, in Xoscript there is only one way,
by reference. Xoscript never makes a copy of a value. To copy an object,
you need to send the message **copy**. 

@test611

Here, you might have expected that the output would be Dolly, instead
of Donny. However, this is not the case as both names refer to the same
object. When working with a loop, something similar occurs:

@test612

In fact, Xoscript **always** uses references, so on **:quantity**
the above-illustrated loop also indicates the reference to the element
in the sequence.

In order to copy an object, you have to specify this action
**explicitly**:

@test613

By sending the unary message **copy** to a string, the object
returns a copy of that same string object. It is possible to copy Number
objects, boolean objects, lists and dicts in the same way.

You can also define your own copy implementation, this is even a
neccesity if you create your own objects. The default
implementation of copy for a list makes a shallow copy, it creates a
new list with the same elements.

@test614

In this case, 4 is added only to the copy.
However, because the copy is shallow, the objects in both sequences
are the same.

@test615

So if we append 2 to each name in the copy, the original
sequence is affected as well.

To remedy this we need to make a **deep copy**. Such a copy action
for a list could be composed as follows:

@test616

Also, note the message recursive, this message is necessary to
send before the copy message.

It is essential to keep in mind that although a copy of an object
often has the same appearance of the original, it will, in fact,
never be the same. The root object defines a message **equal:**,
which can be used to compare the identity of objects. Take a look at the
following example:

@test617

## Implicit Conversion

Xoscript uses **implicit conversion** to convert objects. To print a
list on screen, Xoscript will, for example, send the message
*string* internally to the list. This can proof very useful, in
case you would like to print a sequence as a comma-separated list. The
message *string* can be overwritten: 

@test620

{ Task 1 } except: { Task 2 }, start.
```

You can also cause an error to occur in your program intentionally; and
by doing so, activate the handler block. This is done by sending the
message **error:** to the current task as shown in this next
illustration:

```
{
this-task error: ['Whoops!'].
} except: { :mistake
Out write: mistake.
}, start.
```

## Injecting values

Xoscript provides for tasks the option to inject values. Now, have a look
at the task below:

```
>> sending := {
	Newsletter to: own recipient.
}.
sending set: ['recipient']
value: ['info@recipient.org'].
sending start.
```


This illustration presents an imaginary task, which sends a newsletter
to an email address or **recipient**. This recipient can be injected
into the task, externally and before the task is started, by sending the
message **set:value:** to the task. By doing so, the value of
**recipient** is preset into the task. This value can also be modified
and the task can then be run again. This is a useful method when using
Task objects.

## Empty Functions

Empty tasks are not allowed. In theory an empty task would look like
this: **{}**, however Xoscript perceives this as a language error. If you
like to declare an empty task, you can use the None object:

```
>> task := None.
```

Although, this is not a real task, but a None object, a start message
can still be sent:

```
>> answer := task start.
```

In fact this is the same as:

```
>> answer := None start.
```

Because the object **None** does not recognise the message **start**, it
will return itself as answer, leaving the answer once again **None**.
So, there is no necessity to have an empty task. Due to the elegant
design of the programming language Xoscript, you can simply use the None
object for this.

## Dynamic Scoping

When a Function needs a variable but can't find it,
it will check the variables of the Function that **called** it,
and continue checking up the chain of Functions.
This search process goes on until the variable is found.
If the variable is still not found, an error message will appear. This method of searching for a
variable is called **Dynamic Scoping**.

To illustrate this principle:

# Root Object

{{messages}}

The object named **Object** is the root object of all objects in
Xoscript and provides core language features. 

The most frequently sent message
is **on:do:**, which expands the functionalities of an object. This
message is received by the root object, which consequently links the
specified task to the message, and by doing so expands the derived
object.

## Catch-all methods

Normally if you send a message that does not correspond with
a method in the object, it gets ignored. However, you can specify
so-called **magic methods** or **catch-all** methods that will
get invoked if the message is not understood by the object.

There are 4 catch-all methods available. Each message matches
a specific number of arguments.

Catch-all message    | Number of arguments
-------------------- | -------------------
respond:             | 0
respond:and:         | 1
respond:and:and:     | 2
respond:and:and:and: | 3

Example:

@test619

## Programmatic messages

Instead of sending out a message directly to an object, it can also be
sent via a variable. To do so, you use the message
**message:arguments:**. 

@test396

@api_Object_base

# Lists

{{messages}}

Xoscript knows two types of collections: *lists* and *dicts*.
**Lists** are enumerations of objects in a *fixed order*. Dicts have
no order, instead, resemble a legenda involving a key (or term) and its
corresponding value. Lists are comparable to arrays (PHP, Java, C)
and lists (Python). Dicts are comparable to associative arrays (PHP) or
dictionaries (Python) in other programming languages. In order to create
a new List write:

```
>> fibonacci := List new.
```

This empty sequence can be filled using **append:** :

```
fibonacci append: 0.
fibonacci append: 1.
fibonacci append: 1.
fibonacci append: 2.
fibonacci append: 3.
fibonacci append: 5.
fibonacci append: 8.
fibonacci append: 13.
```

If we write the sequence to screen:

```
Out write: fibonacci, stop.
```

We will see:

```
List ← 0 ; 1 ; 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 5 ; 8 ; 13
```

This output reveals that you can use this shorter notation to declare a
list as well:

```
>> fibonacci := List new ; 0 ; 1 ; 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 5 ; 8 ; 13.
```

The semicolons (;) are all binary messages which put a
value into the sequence.

## Chaining

Suppose you have a list like:

```
>> x := List new ; 1 ; 2 ; 3.
```

If you would like to delete the first and the last element, then your
message would be:

```
x shift pop.
```

Unfortunately, the previous notation will not function correctly. The
message **shift** returns the first element of the sequence, which,
in turn, will become the receiver of the message **pop**. So, the
message **pop** is not sent to **x**, but instead to 2. A
possible solution to this problem would be to create two separate
sentences, such as: 

```
x shift.
x pop.
```

However, this is rather unpractical, in particular when you need to
delete more than two elements. Therefore, Xoscript offers an
alternative message structure for these kinds of situations. In
**alternative** message structures, the answers of objects are ignored
and you will get the receiving object back as answer, time and again.
An **alternative** message structure is initiated by sending the
message **do** to an object and the **alternative** message
structure can be ended by sending the message **done**. In the
example illustrated, this could be applied as follows:

```
>> x := List new ; 1 ; 2 ; 3.*
x do shift pop done.
```

@api_List_collections


# Dicts

{{messages}}

**Both List and Dict are collections. However, contrary to a
list, a dict **has no** order. Another distinction between the two
is that a dict consists of object pairs. One object acts as entry (or
keyword) in order to search for the other object. A good example of a
list is a price list, such as:


```
>> menu := List new *
	put: ['£5'] at: ['apple pie'],
	put: ['£6'] at: ['carrot cake'],
	put: ['£3'] at: ['fudge'].
```

Similar to a list, the message put:at:
is used to add an object to a list. The difference is that, contrary to
a list, two objects are being linked. The first object is, similar
to a list, the object that you will store in a list. The second
object is not its position within the collection, but the **entry**
which enables the previous object to be retrieved at a later time. In
short, a dict works a bit like a dictionary; so, by using the keyword
the meaning can be found. For instance, to retrieve from the
above-mentioned list the price of a fudge:

```
>> price := menu at: ['fudge'].
```

You may also use the concise notation:

```
>> price := menu ? ['fudge'].
```

Should the entries that you apply to store objects be without spaces
(and not collide with other predefined messages),
the next notation can be also be used:

```
>> menu := List new
	pie:   ['£5'],
	cake:  ['£6'],
	fudge: ['£3'].
```

No doubt that the above notation reads a bit more natural.
To request the price of a
fudge, the following simplified notation can be used:

```
>> price := menu fudge.
```

@api_Map_collections

# File

{{messages}}

The **File** object provides basic access to the file system.

@api_File_file

# Date/Time

{{messages}}

For a structured representation of time and date, Xoscript uses the
**Moment** object. In case a new Moment object is printed on screen, the
current date and time are shown:

```
Out write: Moment new, stop.
```

Might result in something like:

```
2020-10-10 12:16:39
```

It is also easy to read out the individual time components. So, for
instance, if it is only necessary to know the current year, the message
**year** can be sent to the moment and, in turn, the reply will be a
Number object containing solely the year:

```
>> m := Moment new.
Out write: m year, stop.
```

@api_Moment_system


# Program/StdOut

{{messages}}

The Program Object represents the currently running app. This object
offers functionality to execute system commands, include sub programs,
read arguments and more. All system related functions.

## StdOut

Out is the standard output object. It basically has two methods:
**write:** and **stop**. The write: message is used to send a string
to stdout, the stop message prints a newline character.
Instead of **stop** you can also use \\n.

Example:

```
Out write: ['Hello World'], stop.
```

result:

```
Hello World
```

## Modules/Plugins

The world of Xoscript can be expanded with new system objects, by
installing modules . A new system object can be added to the world of
Xoscript by placing the module file (usually a file with the suffix .so
or .dll) into the mods folder. 

When you send a message to the object that is made available through the
plugin module, it will be automatically loaded by Xoscript.


## Reflection

There are various ways for system
exploring during program execution. Xoscript holds a couple of methods to
detect which objects are present and to which messages these objects
respond. Firstly, each object can be asked what **type** it is,
however types in Xoscript are malleable and therefore unreliable.

It is also possible to ask the Program object if a
given object is already present in the program:

```
Program Tool true: { ... }.
```

In case of an object
name which consists of one single symbol, it is best to apply the
following notation to avoid confusion:

```
Program find: ['X'], true: { ... }.
```

Besides asking about objects, it is equally possible to ask the
Program object about messages. For instance, it can be asked if the
object **Number** knows the message **between:and:**, in the way
as is illustrated below:

```
Program Number: ['between:and:'], stop.
```

@api_Program_system


# GUI

{{messages}}


The GUI plugin in Xoscript offers functionality to display
graphics and widgets, play sounds, store sensitive data
and send or retrieve data from the internet.

The best way to use the GUI plugin is to load the Guihelper
library. To load the GUI helpers library:

```
Gui use: Path guihelpers.
```

Make sure the guihelpers library file is in the working directory.
Plugins like **Gui** are loaded automatically, so you can address
the Gui object without importing it first. Instead of **Program use:**,
the code reads **Gui use:**, this is important because the former
will load from the filesystem while the latter will first attempt to
load from a datpak, which is useful when exporting the app to a
binary (.exe) or mobile app.

After loading the GUI and its helpers with this single line of code,
you are ready to use GUI functionality.

To create a new view:


```
>> view := View new.

view
	component
	elements
		view
		extends: ['object'],
		elements
			...your elements...
		close
	close.

```


Each view is structured like a tree.
The top-element must always be **component**. Child elements
must be listed under the **elements** section. The first child
of the first elements block always must be **view** and must
extend **object**. In the second element section you can
list your own view elements. Here is a full example:


```
>> app := Gui new.
>> view := View new.

view
	component
	events: True,
	elements
		view
		extends: ['object'],
		elements
			label
			text: ['Hi!'],
			close
		close
	close.

app width: 300 height: 200,
screen: view string.
```

After defining the view tree you can display it by
sending it to the Gui with the **screen:** message.
It is wise to first set the dimensions though (width/height).
To receive events, an element and all its parents must set
**events:True**. Events are send as messages to the GUI instance:

```
app on: ['click:'] do: { :id
	...your event handler...
}.
```

The ID parameter tells you which element has been clicked/touched.
You must set a unique ID number for the element:

```
...
button
id: ['101'],
events: True,
elements
	label
	events: True,
	text: ['click me'],
	close
close
....
``` 

After processing the event, you can update the GUI by replacing a part of it using:

```
gui xml: fragment string name: ['counter'] at: ['102'].		
```

Where fragment is just another view component, name must be
the name of the sub view and **at:** is the parent ID where
the sub view must be inserted (replacing all children of the 
parent node).

| padding: [Number]      | Sets all paddings.                                                                          |

For any ['Number'] you may use:

- a Number (i.e. 1,2,100...)
- a String number (['100'])
- a Percentage string (i.e. ['50%'])

## Form fields

To read the value of a form field use:

```
gui field-value: ['1'].
```

As a parameter, pass the id of the form field element.


## Dialogs

To show a simple dialog using the GUI:

```
Gui show: ['hello world!'].
```

## Network

To send a POST-request to a website:

```
>> net := Network new.
new send: ['postdata'] to: ['https://www.xoscript.com/login'].
```

You can send a GET-request by replacing the post data with None.

## JSON

The JSON object allows you to convert dicts to JSON as well as
the other way around:

```
>> json := JSON jsonify: mydict.
>> dict2 := JSON object: json.
```

## Vault

To store sensitive data like tokens on the client side, you can use
the vault object:

```
>> vault := Vault new: ['myvault'].
vault set: ['mytoken'] password: mytoken.
```

To retrieve a sensitive object:

```
>> token := vault get: ['mytoken'].
```

## Images, Fonts and Colors

In your GUI definition you can attach resources, like
fonts, images and colors. You can create these as follows:

```
>> top := Image new: ['topbar.png'].

>> white := Color new 
			red: 255
			green: 255
			blue: 255.

>> icons := Font new source: ['remixicon.ttf'] size: 40.

```

Attach them to your GUI using the attributes listed above,
i.e. border-color, background-color, background, font etc.

## Datapaks

Instead of loading code, images or music from files you can also add them to a data package and
have your program retrieve them from this package as well. The advantage of a data package that
your resources are bundled in one, opaque package (so people can’t see the images or listen to the
music files separately). Data packages are also required for exports to other platforms like mobile.

With the Package object, you can place files into a data package. You can then link this package to
Media, and from that moment, all files will be retrieved from your data package:

```
>> data := Package new: ['datapackage'].
data add: ['rabbit.png'].
```

To use the data package:

```
Gui link: ['datapackage'].
```

## FFI

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. It allows you to use functionality written by others in
different programming languages, provided through DLL files, SO files, or Dylib files. These could
be a variety of functions, and there's a vast range of available functionality through this method.
Let's start with an example:

>> gui := Gui new.
gui link: (
 List new ;

 ['printf'] ;
 ( List new ; ['pointer'] ; ['int'] ) ;

>> s := Blob utf8: ['FFI has %d letters.\n'].
Printf template: s number: 3.
s free.

The result of this code is that you’ll see the following on the command line:
FFI has 3 letters.
Now, you're probably thinking, "That's a lot of code for something so simple."
I mean, couldn't we just solve this with a Gui show command? The answer is a resounding yes!
But this is meant as an illustrative example.
FFI is usually used for more complex tasks, but those don't make good
examples, so I chose something trivial.

The arguments for link method:

- Argument #1: The DLL or SO file you want to use.
- Argument #2: The function in that file you want to link.
- Argument #3: A sequence with the names of the data types of the function’s arguments.
- Argument #4: The name of the function's return type.
- Argument #5: The name of the object you want to link this function to (if it doesn’t exist, it will be created
automatically).
- Argument #6: The message that this function should be linked to.

In the example above, we want to link the printf function from libc.so. You can find the data
type names in the documentation of the software you are linking to. The available types are:
void, pointer, float, double, int, uint, char, uchar, intX, and uintX,
where X can be 8, 16, 32, or 64.

These types refer to the number of bytes required to store the data. For printf, we are linking to a
new object called Printf and the message template:number:. You translate the external
function into the Xoscript dialect before using it. The message template:number: expects a
buffer with the template text as its first parameter. We create this buffer using a Blob object, which
allows you to manually allocate memory. You are responsible for freeing this memory afterward
with the free message.

You can fill a memory blob in various ways. In our example, we fill it with text, so we use the
utf8: message (UTF-8 is an encoding to convert text into bytes). You can also fill a blob with
fill:, passing a sequence of byte values. To read the contents of a blob, use from:length:.
You’ll get the bytes back as a sequence. You can even create a C-struct with a Blob using the
struct: message, passing a sequence of C types. This may be necessary when calling a C
function in an external software library that expects a pointer to a struct.
